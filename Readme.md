Problem statement

Women worldwide, including in India, continue to face  
serious personal safety challenges in public spaces,  
during travel, at workplaces, and even at home.

Incidents of harassment, assault, and violence have led  
to increased fear, anxiety, and restrictions on women’s  
freedom of movement.

Existing safety tools such as pepper spray, tasers,  
and knives are often unreliable.

They depend heavily on manual use,  
can be easily snatched away,  
are difficult to conceal,  
and are ineffective in sudden, high-stress situations.

Many also fail to provide quick communication  
with authorities during emergencies.

Hence, there is a strong need for an innovative,  
easy-to-use, non-snatchable wearable device  
that can immediately alert authorities,  
share real-time GPS location,  
and help protect the user in moments of danger.


 Idea details 
 Our idea is to create THE SHE SHIELD, 
 a compact wearable taser, combined with an automatic emergency alert system.
 This device stays firmly attached to the wrist and can be activated instantly
 during danger using a pushing force against the attacker. 
 The moment it is triggered, it delivers a controlled defensive pulse and 
 simultaneously sends an SOS alert with real-timeGPS location to emergency contacts.

 The device includes a force sensor based activation to avoid accidental triggers,
 GSM communication so alerts can be sent over SMS/calls, built-in GPS tracking, 
 and multiple safety mechanisms to ensure the safety of the user. 
 Designed to be simple and practical for everyday use, SHE SHIELD offers an all-in-one 
 safety solution that gives women confidence and immediate support when they need it most.
